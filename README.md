Cape manipulation for MCP, Optifine Sources Required!  
1: Breaks optifine you can not see ppl's optifine cape anymore if you plan on using this remeber this is an local/offline server for capes use a cloud server to let   access from anywhere  
2: this logs ips! kinda like offline v4p3  
  
TO DO:
Actually make the server work: done  
Allow upto (infinate) amount of capes per user: not done  
Allow diffrent types of cosmetic: not even going to try this all depends on the pull requests if you have a head band system or a wing system and it is open source and want to implement it copy this repo or dm me on discord and send me the "model" or "base image" for the system and i'll probably implement it 

## running
edit `usernames.json` to your liking, change the file name to your mc username in `capes` then run `npm i && node .`
## How to use
Edit capeutils
